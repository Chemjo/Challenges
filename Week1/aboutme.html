    <h2 class="textbox">About Chase Johns:</h2>
    <p line="center" class="textbox">
    I was born and raised in the Tampa Bay Area, Florida. 
    Despite that, I can't stand the heat and humidity, so it's not very surprising that fall and winter are my favorite seasons.
    I've always enjoyed learning about and studying a wide variety of subjects; moreover, language, culture, and history are particular passions of mine.
    I got my BA in Japanese Language and Culture with minors in Classics and Linguistics from the University of Florida.
    I was also fortunate enough to graduate Cum Laude.
    I was, however, a Biology and Computer Science major previously.
    I was fortunate enough to study abroad in Japan for a semester at Kansai Gaidai University in Hirakata City, Osaka, Japan. 
    It was one of the best experiences of my life, and it's also where I met my S.O. of over 3 years. 
    Graduating in the first half of 2020, we both opted for pursuing online accelerated MBA's to improve our job prospects.
    I recieved my MBA with an International Business concentration in the late fall of 2022.
    I've enjoyed dabbling in a wide variety of both performing and visual arts as an amatuer just as much as I've enjoyed software development and making automated factory systems in modded version of Minecraft.
    I play a DND homebrew campaign based in the world of the Mistborn series weekly run by my S.O. with our friends across the country.
    I also tend to ramble, so I'll stop here for now.
