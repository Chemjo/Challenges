        <value>About Me: I was born and raised in Saint Petersburg, Florida. In undergrad, I majored in Japanese Language and Culture and minored in Classics and Linguistics. I also have an MBA with an International Business concentration. I enjoy fantasy, and my favorite author is Brandon Sanderson. His novels in the Cosmere are some of the best I&apos;ve read. I enjoy cooking, tie-dying, and gaming of all kinds. I can&apos;t choose a single favorite Pokemon, but I especially enjoy Steel types such as Metagross, Jirachi, and Tinkaton.</value>
